# WPF C# Tutorial â€“ Create Parallax Scrolling Endless Runner Game in Visual Studio

In this project I will demonstrate how to make a simple endless runner game inside of visual studio using WPF and C#. This game will utilize different game programming methods such as sprite animation, hit test / collision and background scrolling. 

We will use simple JPG and separate sprite images to build this game including running animation of the main character with only C#. WPF has made making games a lot easier with and we will see how to make a fun and simple game inside of visual studio using these methods.  We can work more accurately with transparency now and this makes the games look so much better than windows form games. 

You can make similar games on Unity and C# but I wanted to see if i can make something like this inside of WPF without any other framework or libraries and share my findings with you. 

We will do some simple GUI set ups first and then dive right into the C# programming where we will add our main game timer, work with bitmaps and load out own custom animations and show it to the screen. 

If you aren't familiar with WPF C# just yet don't worry this tutorial is aimed for beginners and we will go through each part of the programming together. In the above website address you will find the full written tutorial including the source code for this game and the images you can download and make your own. 

Hope you find this game tutorial useful in your journey and keep learning from different projects. 

Happy Programming. Moo Out.
